18 years, were in the subacute phase of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke (days 5-45 after stroke onset), \
were able to sit unsupported for at least 30 seconds, were considered able to perform aerobic exercise \
by the responsible trial physician, and had a Barthel index score of 65 or less at the time of enrolment. \
The Barthel index measures activities of daily living based on 10 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 100 \
pointsâ€”higher scores indicating less dependence.15 Key exclusion criteria were intracranial haemorrhage from\
 a ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, inability to perform required physical exercise, assisted \
 walking before stroke, or severe cardiac or psychiatric comorbidities. If study requirements were met, trial \
 physicians assessed information on stroke type and medical conditions after written informed consent was obtained. \
